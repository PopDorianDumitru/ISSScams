// STILL WORKING ON LEGACY MOCKUSERREPOSITORY WITH BANDAID SQL SELECT
    -> NEED TO MOVE WHOLE APPLICATION TO USERREPOSITORY SOLUTION

// BOTH USERWRAPPER AND MOCKUSER APPEAR RANDOMLY AND INCONSISTENLY
    -> NEED TO GET RID OF MOST MOCKUSER APPEARANCES AND WORK SOLELY WITH USERWRAPPER

// NEED TO PORT CONNECTION STRING TO CONFIG FILE
    -> ????????? NO SOLUTION FOR THIS ONE YET

// HANDLE MORE GRACEFULLY THE CONNECTION PROBLEMS FOR THE COMPANIES API (THEY WON'T BE ONLINE ANYWAY, UNLESS SANDBOXED)
    -> WARNING THROWING? ERRORS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN, AND WE SHOULDN'T PRINT TO CONSOLE IN CONTROLLER

// WILL ADD C# MISSING LINKS AS WE GO
